# Script to restore user accounts and user directories from the ds_backup_data.sh
# Uses the files backed up to MAC address of the machine,
# stored in the DeployStudio repository Backups folder

function help {
	
    cat<<EOF

	Usage: `basename $0` [ -e "guest admin shared" ] [ -v "/Volumes/Macintosh HD" ] [ -u /Users ] [ -d "/Volumes/External Drive/" ] [ -t tar ]
	Variables can be set in DeployStudio variables window when running script.
	BackupRestore Variables:
	-q Unique Identifier.
			Enter the MAC address of the backup you want to restore.
			For example, if you backup a computer and its MAC address
			was: 000000000001. You can then specify that MAC as the
			variable to restore to a different computer.
	-v Target volume
			Specify full path to mount point of volume
			Default is the \$DS_LAST_RESTORED_VOLUME volume
			e.g. "/Volumes/Macintosh HD"
	-u User path on target
			Set to path of users on volume
			Default is /Users
	-r Backup Repository Path
			Set to path of the backup volume
			Default is the DS Repository
			e.g. "/Volumes/NFSDrive/Backups"

# 
# Tuesday, March 22, 2011 - v0.4.6
# 	- Fix home restore to only restore *HOME.tar files
# 	- Only restore filevault keychains when they don't exist on target
# 	- Added restore for local accounts with filevault within script

# 	- Added variables for
# 		Unique_ID
# 		Target Volume
# 		Backup repository path
# 	- Bug fixed ditto commands
# 	- Pass custom UNIQUE_ID for restoring homes to different computer
# 		To restore homes from different machine, use MAC of old machine as UNIQUE_ID
#
# Monday, January 31, 2011
# 	- Added flag to backup using ditto or tar, check help
# 
# Tuesday, January 28, 2011
# 	- Added p flag to tar to restore permissions
