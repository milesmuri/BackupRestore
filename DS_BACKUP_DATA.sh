# Script to backup home folders on volume before restoring disk image with DeployStudio
# Uses the directories in the /Users folder of the target machine to back up data, user account details, and password.
# Use accompanying ds_restore_data.sh to pur users and user folders back onto computer after re-imaging.

# Modified for use with OS X Lion 10.7
# Streamlined to take into account only non-filevault network users.
# Bugs:
#	- the scripts as they were in 10.6 break in 10.7 because of an
#	incompatibility between the local user repository and the dscl
#	command i.e. dscl from 10.6 won't run under a 10.7 nbi, dscl from
#	a 10.7 nbi can't read the 10.6 db...

    Usage: `basename $0` [ -e "guest admin shared" ] [ -v "/Volumes/Macintosh HD" ] [ -u /Users ] [ -d "/Volumes/External Drive/" ] [ -t tar ]
    Variables can be set in DeployStudio variables window when running script.
    BackupRestore Variables:
    -q Unique Identifier 
			Enter the MAC address of the backup you want to restore.
			For example, if you backup a computer and its MAC address
			was: 000000000001. You can then specify that MAC as the
			variable to restore to a different computer.
		 	Read Me has more information on its use.
	-c Remove User Cache
			Will delete the Users /Library/Cache
	 		folder before backing up the data.
    -e Users to Skip
            Must use quotes for multiple users
            Default is "guest" and "shared"
                You must specify "guest" and
                "shared" if your use the argument
    -v Target volume
            Specify full path to mount point of volume
            Default is the internal volume
            e.g. /Volumes/Macintosh HD
    -u User path on target
            Set to path of users on volume
            Default is /Users
    -d Backup destination
            Specify full path to the backup volume
            Default is /tmp/DSNetworkRepository
    -t Backup tool (tar) - Still working on this one!
            Select backup software, Default tar
            tar = Use tar with gzip to backup.
            ditto and rsync NOT WORKING, yet!
            -removed- ditto = Use ditto with gzip to backup
            -removed- rsync = Use rsync to backup

## To Do
#
# Test USB Ethernet dongle for one machine
# Plan for "Deleted Users" folder

## Changes
# 
# Wednesday, June, 22, 2011 - v0.7.1
#	- Added flag to remove user cache folder before backing up home.
# 	- Testing new DS_INTERNAL_DRIVE variable command.
# 
# Tuesday, April, 19, 2011 - v0.7
# 	- Updated code to use new user deliminator from '.' to '-'
# 
# Saturday, April, 16, 2011 - v0.6
# 	- Lots of little error fixes from midnight coding.
# 	- Tried to unify script messages
# 
# Monday, April, 14, 2011 - v0.5
#	- Change name of user plists and home backups to account for names with '.' in them.
# 
# Monday, March, 28, 2011 - v0.4.7
# 	- Moved dscl and internal directory variables outside and above for loop. 
#	- Uncommented test variables. Easier to troubleshoot the script.
# 
# Tuesday, March 22, 2011 - v0.4.6
# 	- Filevault restores done with first boot scripts
# 	- Removed extra plist created with backup tool name. If I need this, I'll use the same plist as the user details.
# 	- Added AuthenticationAuthority and HomeDirectory to plist backup
# 	- Some dscl and PlistBuddy errors show when running scripts, this is normal.
# 	- Added "deleted users" folder to exclude list
# 
# Friday, March 18, 2011 - v0.4.5
# 	- Changed test for mobile/network accounts, again. Now seems to work!
# 
# Wednesday, Febuary 09, 2011 - v0.4.4
# 	- Adding to git
# 	- Added rsync as an backup tool option
# 	- Removed Unique ID from user data, its only used for the backup folder.
# 	- Changed test for mobile/network accounts. Should work better.
# 
# Tuesday, February 01, 2011
# 	- Bug fixing the tar and ditto backups and variables
# 
# Monday, January 31, 2011
# 	- Added flag to backup using ditto or tar, check help
# 
# Thursday, January 27, 2011
# 	- Chenged the way we check for network and mobile accounts. Now looking at dscl for OriginalNodeName
# 		Thanks to hunterbj
#
# Tuesday, January 18, 2011
# 	- Adding variables that can be set within DeployStudio
#		Icluding: Users to skip, Target volume, User path on target, and Backup destination
# 
# Monday December 20, 2010 
# 	- Fixed issue with user account not showing in system preferences after restoring.
# 	- Added support for restoring admin rights for network users

# How to Backup Filevault homes
# 	Filevault accounts have GeneratedUID
# 	dscl . read /Users/file HomeDirectory | awk '{print $2}'
# 	Backup sparseimage
# 	/Users/file/file.sparsebundle
# 	- Backup keychain master passwords and cert
# 	- /Library/Keychain/FileVaultMaster.cer
# 	- /Library/Keychain/FileVaultMaster.keychain
# 	Recreate user - Wonder if its necessary to restore the accounts?
# 	/System/Library/CoreServices/ManagedClient.app/Contents/Resources/createmobileaccount -n usershortname
# 	Restore sparesimage

# Written by Rusty Myers
# 
# Credit to Pete Akins and his amazingly awesome createUser.pkg script. 
# It was instrumental in learning how to backup and create users.
